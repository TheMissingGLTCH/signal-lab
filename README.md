# signal-lab
experience engine for generative art that feels like discovering a secret lab: -Starter pieces (pre-coded visual/audio sketches) -Expressive controls (sliders, toggles, palettes — not raw code) -Code visibility (for curious tinkerers, but optional) -Instant feedback (every tweak updates live)  Think: "Loom as a creative toy, not a dev tool."
